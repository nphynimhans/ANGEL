Neurosci. 10:1. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2016.00001] (http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2016.00001/abstract)*

Please cite the same in case you are using the ANGEL paradigm for your study. Please note that the source code is being provided without any support or warranty of any kind. 

*Contents:*
* ANGELParadigm - Theis contains the ANGEL paradigm for presentation in English, Hindi and Kannada languages. This also contains rest and meditation paradigm for a related study. 
* ANGELFunctions - This contains MATLAB functions and scripts for EEG and ERP analysis done for the paper.

The code was written using the following platform and toolboxes:
* MATLAB 2013a on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1
* EEGLAB v13.4.4 MATLAB toolbox 
* ERPLAB v4 plugin for EEGLAB
* Measure Projection Toolbox plugin for EEGLAB
* Clean Raw Plugin for EEGLAB

The ANGEL Paradigm was developed using scripts written in EPrime v2
 
The paradigm has been used in EGI 128 Channel and Neuroscan 64 Channel systems on Windows platform. The code has comments and is written in a readable way. Updates will be provided later as and when possible.
